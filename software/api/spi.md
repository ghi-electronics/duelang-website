## [Python](#tab/py)
```py
arrayWrite = [ 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x55 ]
arrayRead = [0] * 4
chipselect = 2

duelink.Spi.Write(arrayWrite)
duelink.Spi.Write(arrayWrite, 0, 2, chipselect)

duelink.Spi.Read(arrayRead)
duelink.Spi.Read(arrayRead, 0, 2, chipselect)

duelink.Spi.WriteRead(arrayWrite, 0, arrayWrite.Length, arrayRead, 0, arrayRead.Length, chipselect)
```

## [JavaScript](#tab/js)
```js
let arrayWrite = [ 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x55 ]
let arrayRead = new Uint8Array(4)
let chipselect = 2;

await duelink.Spi.Write(arrayWrite)
await duelink.Spi.Write(arrayWrite, 0, 2, chipselect)

await duelink.Spi.Read(arrayRead)
await duelink.Spi.Read(arrayRead, 0, 2, chipselect)

await duelink.Spi.WriteRead(arrayWrite, 0, arrayWrite.Length, arrayRead, 0, arrayRead.Length, chipselect)
```

## [.NET](#tab/net)
```cs
var arrayWrite = new byte[4] { 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x55 };
var arrayRead = new byte[4];
var chipselect = 2;

duelink.Spi.Write(arrayWrite); 
duelink.Spi.Write(arrayWrite, 0, 2, chipselect);

duelink.Spi.Read(arrayRead);
duelink.Spi.Read(arrayRead, 0, 2, chipselect);

duelink.Spi.WriteRead(arrayWrite, 0, arrayWrite.Length, arrayRead, 0, arrayRead.Length, chipselect);
